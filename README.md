# Surfs_Up

## Overview
The purpose of this challenge was to determine what the temperature trends were and are in the months of June and December in Oahu. We work with W. Avy to determine whether the surf and ice cream shop is sustainable year round.

## Results

#### Three Takeaways from the Analysis

There are over 1500 data points retrieved from both the month of June and July. Thus, there are enough data points to have increased confidence in the description of the statistics.

One consistency is in the average temperature for both months. In June the average temperature is 74.9 degrees Farenheit and 71.04 degrees Farenheit in December. Each with a standard deviation between 3-4 degrees. Consistency year round seems to be maintained.

The variance can come in December when temperatures can drop down to 56 degrees farenheit. When in June the temperature did not go below 64 degrees.

Even with the low minimum temperature in December the 25% quartile is still 69 degrees. In June the 25% quartile was 73 degrees. 


## Summary

Overall the temperatures in June and December are consistent with each other. There may be some colder days in December then June but overall the variance is minimal. There would have to be revenue projections in place that in the month of December and surrounding months there may be days that are not as profitable and there should be preparation for that.
